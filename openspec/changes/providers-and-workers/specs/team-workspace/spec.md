## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Members is a read-only inspection of group settings
The Members tab SHALL list each of the team's groups with its role description, live membership, task-creation right, effective workers grouped by provider with caps and live counts, effective approval policy, member cap, routing strategy and limit policy, effort with any per-model effort, and routing warnings. No control SHALL edit a group. A prompt change SHALL affect future agent starts only and SHALL NOT elevate runtime permissions.

#### Scenario: Caps show live counts
- **WHEN** a group allows two members on a model and one is live
- **THEN** the row shows 1 of 2 for that model with the live member named

#### Scenario: Workers are grouped by provider
- **WHEN** the `juniors` group sets `workers: { glm-flash: 3, haiku: 2 }`, with `glm-flash` a model of provider Z.AI and `haiku` a model of provider Claude
- **THEN** the group's row shows `glm-flash` under Z.AI and `haiku` under Claude, each with its cap and live count

#### Scenario: Members cannot be edited
- **WHEN** the human opens the Members tab
- **THEN** it presents no control that writes a group file or changes a running agent's permissions

#### Scenario: A warning names what fell back
- **WHEN** a group file lists a model the catalog does not define
- **THEN** the group's row shows that warning alongside the settings that took effect

#### Scenario: Per-profile effort is shown beside the group effort
- **WHEN** a group sets `effort: low` and `modelEffort: { haiku: xhigh }`
- **THEN** the group's row shows effort `low` together with `xhigh` for the `haiku` model
